# Attendance Using Face detection
# Overview
This project aims to automate the attendance-taking process in a classroom or any gathering using face detection technology. The system uses a camera to capture images of people's faces, detects and recognizes the faces, and then marks their attendance. This project can be useful for schools, universities, and organizations that need to take attendance frequently.

# Features
Detects and recognizes faces in real-time

Captures and saves images of the attendees for future reference

Records the attendance in a CSV file

Can handle multiple faces at once

Easy to use and can be customized based on the user's needs

# Technologies Used
OpenCV: for face detection and recognition

Python: for the programming language

Pandas: for data manipulation and analysis

CSV: for data storage

Haar Cascades: for detecting faces in images

# How to Use
Clone the repository to your local machine

Install the necessary libraries listed in the requirements.txt file

Run the attendance_system.py file

The camera will open up, and attendees can position themselves in front of it

The system will detect and recognize their faces and mark their attendance

The attendance record will be saved in a CSV file named "attendance.csv"

# Future Improvements
Implement a GUI for ease of use

Use deep learning models for better face recognition accuracy

Add a feature to send attendance reports via email
